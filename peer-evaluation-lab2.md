## Partner's Name: Erica Saenz

### 1. **Contribution to the Project**
   - Did your partner contribute effectively to the completion of the project tasks?  
   **Rating (0-5):** 4  
   **Comment:** She tried to get as much done as she could understand. This was a hard lab on both of us since both of us were having a hard time understanding how riscv_single.sv worked.

### 2. **Communication**
   - Was your partner clear, responsive, and collaborative in their communication?  
   **Rating (0-5):** 4  
   **Comment:** She was quick to respond when I messaged her. The only issue I had was messaging her over break spring break, but I can't blame wanting to get some rest from school.

### 3. **Problem-Solving Skills**
   - Did your partner demonstrate initiative and problem-solving abilities?  
   **Rating (0-5):** 3  
   **Comment:** She tried throwing out some ideas, but I got most of the instructions working correctly. She definitely was a lot less afraid to "break the code" than I was though.

### 4. **Reliability**
   - Was your partner dependable in meeting deadlines and completing assigned tasks?  
   **Rating (0-5):** 3  
   **Comment:** Both of us had trouble meeting the deadline for this lab, so I don't want to be harsh on her for not meeting deadlines this time.

---

### 5. **Teamwork**
   - Did your partner work well as part of the team and support a positive working environment?  
   **Rating (0-5):** 4  
   **Comment:** We were able to work well together when we had time. This lab really showed me that our schedules just don't give us a lot of time outside of the lab to work at Endeavor at the same time. It's hard to say that we did well when this lab was turned in late.
